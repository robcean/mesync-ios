# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

meSync is an iOS personal productivity and habit-tracking application built with SwiftUI and SwiftData. The app helps users synchronize their daily routines by managing tasks, habits, and medications in one unified interface.

## Build and Development Commands

### Building the Project
```bash
# Open the project in Xcode
open meSync.xcodeproj

# Build from command line (requires Xcode Command Line Tools)
xcodebuild -project meSync.xcodeproj -scheme meSync -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build

# Run tests
xcodebuild test -project meSync.xcodeproj -scheme meSync -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### Common Development Tasks
- **Build**: Cmd+B in Xcode
- **Run**: Cmd+R in Xcode  
- **Test**: Cmd+U in Xcode
- **Clean**: Cmd+Shift+K in Xcode
- **Run single test**: Click the diamond next to test method in Xcode

### Git Commands
```bash
# Commit with co-author (as per build-log.md convention)
git commit -m "Your message

## Architecture Overview

### Design System Philosophy
The app implements a CSS-like centralized design system inspired by web development:

1. **AppTheme.swift** - Design tokens hub containing:
   - `AppColors` - All color definitions (primary, secondary, backgrounds, states)
   - `AppSpacing` - Standardized spacing scale (xs through xxxl)
   - `AppTypography` - Font styles and sizes
   - `AppIcons` - SF Symbol icon references
   - `AppDimensions` - Fixed dimensions for UI elements

2. **ViewExtensions.swift** - Reusable view modifiers that work like CSS classes:
   - `.primaryTitleStyle()`, `.subtitleStyle()`, `.captionStyle()` - Text styles
   - `.sectionCardStyle()`, `.headerContainerStyle()` - Container styles
   - `.standardPadding()`, `.standardHorizontalPadding()` - Spacing helpers

3. **ButtonStyles.swift** - Button-specific styles and effects

**Important**: Never use hardcoded values. Always reference the design system.

### State Management Architecture

1. **QuickAddState** - Centralized navigation state using enum pattern:
   - States: `hidden`, `accordion`, `taskForm`, `habitForm`, `medicationForm`
   - Manages form transitions and data flow
   - Single source of truth for navigation

2. **SwiftData Models** - Persistence layer:
   - `TaskData` - Simple task model
   - `HabitData` - Complex habit model with repetition logic
   - `MedicationData` - Medication tracking with dose times

3. **Dynamic Instance Generation**:
   - Habits and medications don't create database entries for each occurrence
   - `HabitInstance` and `MedicationInstance` are generated on-demand
   - 3-day window optimization for performance
   - State tracked via unique keys: `"{id}_{date}_{dose}"`

### Core Architectural Patterns

1. **Protocol-Oriented Design**:
   - `ItemProtocol` unifies different data types for display
   - Enables polymorphic list rendering

2. **View Composition**:
   - Small, focused view components
   - Heavy use of computed properties for derived state
   - Extracted subviews for readability

3. **Repetition Algorithms**:
   - Daily: `daysDifference % interval == 0`
   - Weekly: Check specific weekdays + week interval
   - Monthly: Check day of month + month interval
   - Custom: Specific days array

4. **Form Management**:
   - Forms support create and edit modes
   - Auto-focus on primary fields
   - Validation before save
   - Automatic cleanup on cancel

## Critical Implementation Details

### Habit Repetition System
The app uses an innovative approach where habits are stored once in the database but instances are generated dynamically based on repetition rules. This prevents database bloat and enables complex repetition patterns.

### Medication "Take Now" Feature
Medications support both scheduled doses and unscheduled "take now" doses, critical for as-needed medications like blood pressure pills. Unscheduled doses are tracked separately.

### Performance Optimizations
- 3-day window for habit/medication generation
- Lazy loading in lists
- Computed properties for derived values
- Minimal database queries

### Spanish Development Context
The original development (see prompts.md) was done in Spanish. Key Spanish terms in documentation:
- "HÃ¡bitos" = Habits
- "Tareas" = Tasks  
- "Medicamentos" = Medications

## Known Patterns and Conventions

1. **Always use design system tokens** - No hardcoded colors, spacing, or fonts
2. **Maintain form state consistency** - Reset on cancel, validate on save
3. **Use proper SwiftData annotations** - `@Model` for persistence
4. **Follow animation conventions** - 0.3s duration for most transitions
5. **Implement proper error handling** - Though TODOs exist for user alerts
6. **Test on multiple screen sizes** - App should work on all iPhones/iPads

## Future Considerations

The codebase is designed to be portable to Android (as noted in prompts.md). The centralized design system and clear separation of concerns facilitate this future migration.
